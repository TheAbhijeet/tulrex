# TulRex

A collection of fast, client-side web tools I built for developers and creators who want quick utilities without servers, ads, or tracking.

Everything in TulRex is pre-built and served as static content. There’s **no database** and no server-side processing. Your data stays in your browser.

## Why?

I use many such tools everyday but I didn’t want to upload documents or images to random sites. So I made TulRex: a privacy-first, static site with useful, offline-friendly utilities.

## Tech stack
* React Js
* Next Js 
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* pnpm (package manager)

## Quick start (using pnpm)

```bash

# install
pnpm install

# dev
pnpm dev

# build for production
pnpm build

# run production server (or use your preferred static host)
pnpm start
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Preferred workflow:

1. Open an issue to discuss larger changes.
2. Create a branch for your feature/fix.
3. Submit a clean PR with a short description and tests (if applicable).

If you want to add a new tool follow existing patterns (TypeScript + client-only code).
